# kargo-workshop

## Steps for the workshop

1. Go to [this repository (Click here!](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/edgecase2024-kargo-demo.git) and fork it.\
   Copy the URL (it should end with **.git**) of this forked repo, as you'll need it in step 4.

2. Start the dev container, which can be done in 2 ways:

   * Open GitHub, clone this repo with one of the following commands:
     ```bash
     # https
     git clone https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/edgecase2024-kargo-workshop.git
     
     # ssh
     git clone git@github.com:fullstaq-labs/edgecase2024-kargo-workshop.git
     ```
     Open the folder where you've cloned the repo locally in Visual Studio Code and follow the instructions from the image below.\
     ![instructions local vscode](./docs/local-vscode.gif)
     > [!NOTE]
     > Don't forget to stop and delete your Codespace afterwards!
   * Go to [this Repo](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/edgecase2024-kargo-workshop) in GitHub and open Codespaces (follow the instructions from the image below).\
     ![instructions remote vscode](./docs/remote-vscode.gif)

3. When the container starts, the following tools are installed:

   * **Kind cluster**\
     Kargo needs to run on a Kubernetes cluster.
     Therefore, we will create a Kubernetes cluster using [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io).
   * **Cert-Manager**\
     [Cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is used for self-signing a certificate used to identify Kargo's webhook server to the Kubernetes API server. 
   * **ArgoCD**\
     To deploy applications to the Kubernetes cluster, ArgoCD needs to be available.
   * **Argo-Rollouts**\
     To use [AnalysisTemplate resources](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/analysis/), Argo Rollouts is needed.
   * **Kargo**\
     Obviously, [Kargo](https://kargo.akuity.io) is needed for this workshop :-)

> [!NOTE]
> - [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) is used to orchestrate all these scripts.
> - [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) is used for structured logs and a user-like interface.

4. Run the following command in the container (the value should be the url of the repo you just forked.):
   ```bash
   export GITOPS_REPO_URL="<Replace this value>.git"
   ```

5. If you don't have a GitHub token, start creating one.
   This needs to be a classic token; creation is explained in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

### Basic Scenario

With these next steps, we will start the basic scenario.

6. We are now going to apply the configuration in the Kubernetes cluster.

   To make it easy for you, I've prepared some manifests, which can be found in the folder [demo-basic](./demo-basic).

   The following parts are created:

   * ArgoCD ApplicationSet
   * Kargo Project
   * Kubernetes secret containing the repository credentials
   * Kargo Warehouse
   * Kargo Stages
 
   To apply the changes, I've created a taskfile that will inject certain values.
   You can apply the code with the following command:

   ```bash
   task init_basic
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Have a look at the manifests that are applied, which are in the folder [demo-basic](./demo-basic).
> Important for the flow are the stages.
> To get a better understanding of the flow, take a look at the `promotionMechanisms`.
> Look for the difference between the test and other stages.

7. We are now going to have our first experience with the Kargo CLI (which is preinstalled in this environment).

   First, let's check if the Kargo CLI is working correctly:

   ```bash
   kargo
   ```

   The result should look like this:

   ```console
   Usage:
   kargo [flags]
   kargo [command]

   Available Commands:
   apply       Apply a resource from a file or from stdin
   approve     Manually approve a piece of freight for promotion to a stage
   completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
   config      Manage Kargo CLI configuration
   create      Create a resource from a file or from stdin
   dashboard   Open the Kargo Dashboard in your default browser
   delete      Delete resources by file and names
   get         Display one or many resources
   grant       Grant a role to a user or grant permissions to a role
   help        Help about any command
   login       Log in to a Kargo API server
   logout      Log out of the Kargo API server
   promote     Promote a piece of freight
   refresh     Refresh a stage or warehouse
   revoke      Revoke a role from a user or revoke permissions from a role
   server      Start a local Kargo API server
   update      Update a resource
   verify      Verify a stage
   version     Show the client and server version information

   Flags:
   -h, --help   help for kargo

   Use "kargo [command] --help" for more information about a command.
   ```

   To interact with the environment, we need to log in to Kargo:

   ```bash
   kargo login https://localhost:31444 --admin --password=admin --insecure-skip-tls-verify
   ```

   After that, let's set the Project for the next steps using the following command:

   ```bash
   kargo config set-project "demo-basic"
   ```

   Now let's start reviewing our applied configuration with some commands.

   Check the Projects:

   ```bash
   kargo get projects
   ```

   Check the Warehouses:

   ```bash
   kargo get warehouses
   ```

   Check the Stages:

   ```bash
   kargo get stages
   ```

   Check the Freight:

   ```bash
   kargo get freight
   ```

   All these commands should show you some output.

8. Now we have a solid base to work with.

   Let's start promoting the `test` Stage.
   This promotion makes it possible to promote the image from the piece of Freight to the Stage.

   To do this, we first need to know which freight is available with the following command:

   ```bash
   kargo get freight
   ```

   Copy the "alias", which we need in the next command:

   ```bash
   kargo promote --stage=test --freight-alias=<Freight alias>

   ## Use the following command to follow the status (exit with Ctrl + C)
   watch kargo get promotions
   ```

9. It's not only possible to view the result on the command line, but also in the Kargo Dashboard.

   Normally you can open this with the command:

   ```bash
   kargo dashboard
   ```

   Unfortunately, this doesn't work in the dev container, so please [click here](https://localhost:31444) (ignore certificate errors, just proceed to the website).

   Login with user `admin` and password `admin` and click on the project `demo-basic`.

10. After the promotion, a process in ArgoCD is started to deploy the application through ArgoCD.
    To view this process, go to ArgoCD by [clicking here](https://localhost:31443) (ignore certificate errors, just proceed to the website).

    Login with user `admin` and password `admin`.

    If you want to see progress from the application, click on the `test` Application.
    You should be able to see a fully deployed application.

11. Now that I've explained how you can handle the promotion to Stages, you should be able to do it yourself.

    Before you start promoting in the normal way, first try to directly promote to `prod`.
    You should receive an error, but there is a way of working around this (in case of emergency).

    Kargo has the possibility to approve a piece of Freight for a certain Stage. This can be done using the following command:

    ```bash
    kargo approve --stage prod --freight-alias <Freight alias>
    ```

12. Once done, your Kargo dashboard should look something like:

    ![Kargo dashboard showing the Stages and Freight of the demo-basic Project](./docs/basic-result-kargo.png)

    ArgoCD should look like:

    ![ArgoCD dashboard showing the demo-basic Applications](./docs/basic-result-argocd.png)

13. To verify, you can view all workloads running on the workshop cluster.
    Just run the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -A -l "project=demo-basic"
    ```

### Advanced Scenario

14. We are now going to apply the configuration of the advanced scenario in the Kubernetes cluster.
    To make it easy for you, I've prepared some manifests, which can be found in the folder [demo-advanced](./demo-advanced).

    The following parts are created:

    * ArgoCD ApplicationSet
    * Kargo Project
    * Kubernetes secret containing the repository credentials
    * Kargo Warehouse
    * Kargo Stages
  
    To apply the changes, I've created a taskfile that will inject certain values.
    You can apply the code with the following command:

    ```bash
    task init_advanced
    ```

    As you can see, this scenario has many more Stages and different dependencies.
    A new element, AnalysisTemplate resources, is also introduced, which we will use later in this scenario.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Have a look at the manifests that are applied, which are in the folder [demo-advanced](./demo-advanced).
> Compared to the basic demo, there are more changes than just the number of stages.
> The kargo.yaml file now also has analysistemplates, which you will see later during the workshop.

15. Let's check if everything is deployed correctly!

    First, set the correct Project:

    ```bash
    kargo config set-project "demo-advanced"
    ```

    Now let's start reviewing our applied configuration with some commands.

    Check the Projects (you will now see 2 of them):

    ```bash
    kargo get projects
    ```

    Check the Warehouses:

    ```bash
    kargo get warehouses
    ```

    Check the Stages:

    ```bash
    kargo get stages
    ```

    Check the Freight:

    ```bash
    kargo get freight
    ```

    All these commands should show you some output.

16. As we did with the basic scenario, we should promote the `test` Stage.

    In order to do that, we first need to get the Freight (which differs from the basic demo):

    ```bash
    kargo get freight
    ```

    After that, copy the "alias" which we need in the next command:

    ```bash
    kargo promote --stage=test --freight-alias=<Freight alias>

    ## Use the following command to follow the status (exit with Ctrl + C)
    watch kargo get promotions
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to have a look at [the dashboard](https://localhost:31444).
> Now you should see two projects; choose *demo-advanced*.

17. As in the basic demo, we also have to promote the other Stages.

    Let's start with promoting to `uat`:

    ```bash
    kargo promote --stage=uat --freight-alias=<Freight alias>

    ## Use the following command to follow the status (exit with Ctrl + C)
    watch kargo get promotions
    ```

18. Now let's promote to `pre-prod-b` **(not `pre-prod-a`!)**:

    ```bash
    kargo promote --stage=pre-prod-b --freight-alias=<Freight alias>

    ## Use the following command to follow the status (exit with Ctrl + C)
    watch kargo get promotions
    ```

    There is a big difference here compared to the basic demo.

    An AnalysisTemplate runs in the background and should prevent promotion from `pre-prod-b` to `prod-canary`.

    Let's try this:

    ```bash
    kargo promote --stage=prod-canary --freight-alias=<Freight alias>

    ## Use the following command to follow the status (exit with Ctrl + C)
    watch kargo get promotions
    ```

    If you haven't done this, please have a look at the AnalysisTemplate.
    This can be done through the manifests in this repository and also through the Kargo UI.

19. After this, promote to `pre-prod-a`:

    ```bash
    kargo promote --stage=pre-prod-a --freight-alias=<Freight alias>

    ## Use the following command to follow the status (exit with Ctrl + C)
    watch kargo get promotions
    ```

    Now you should be able to promote to the other Stages.
    So promote to `prod-canary` and `prod-ga`.

20. To verify, you can view all workloads running on the workshop cluster.

    Just run the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -A -l "project=demo-advanced"
    ```

21. Once done, your Kargo dashboard should look something like:

    ![Kargo dashboard showing the Stages and Freight of the demo-advanced Project](./docs/advanced-result-kargo.png)

    ArgoCD should look like:

    ![ArgoCD dashboard showing the demo-advanced Applications](./docs/advanced-result-argocd.png)

22. Now we've completed the entire flow :tada:!

    We are now going to create a new piece of Freight.
    This can be done by changing the version of the value of `semverConstraint` for the Warehouse (in [this file](./demo-advanced/kargo.yaml)):

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kargo.akuity.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Warehouse
    metadata:
        name: ${KARGO_PROJECT}
        namespace: ${KARGO_PROJECT}
    spec:
        subscriptions:
        - image:
            repoURL: nginx
            semverConstraint: <new SemVer constraint, i.e. "*" or ">=1.27.0">
    ```

23. After completing the change, let's apply the change:

    ```bash
    task init_advanced
    ```

24. When done, start promoting all Stages:

    * test
    * uat
    * pre-prod-a
    * pre-prod-b
    * prod-canary
    * prod-ga
